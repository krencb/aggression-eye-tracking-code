# Aggression Eye-Tracking Code

This repository contains the full analysis pipeline for profiling aggressive tendencies using eye-tracking data in two populations: youth (scholars) and adults (college students).

## Contents

- `aggression_profiling_eye_tracking_youth.ipynb`: End-to-end notebook for youth data
- `aggression_profiling_eye_tracking_college.ipynb`: End-to-end notebook for college data
- Preprocessing, encoding, normalization
- Supervised models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, MLP, CatBoost, Voting, Stacking
- Unsupervised clustering: KMeans, DBSCAN, GMM + t-SNE/PCA

## How to Run

Run the notebooks in Google Colab or locally with Python 3.10+.  
Ensure the required libraries are installed (see `requirements.txt`).

## Citation

The dataset will be publicly available on Zenodo (DOI pending) to ensure reproducibility and compliance with PeerJ standards.
